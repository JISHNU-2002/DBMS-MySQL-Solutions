# SQL Commands

SQL (Structured Query Language) statements are generally categorized into five main types

## 01 Data Definition Language (DDL)
   - **Purpose:** Defines the structure of the database
   - **Common Commands**
     - `CREATE`: Creates a new table, database, index, or view
     - `ALTER`: Modifies an existing database object, such as a table or view
     - `DROP`: Deletes an existing table, database, or view
     - `TRUNCATE`: Removes all records from a table, but not the table itself

- **CREATE**
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE Employees (
      EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
      FirstName VARCHAR(50),
      LastName VARCHAR(50),
      Department VARCHAR(50)
  );
  ```

- **ALTER**
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE Employees
  ADD DateOfBirth DATE;
  ```

- **DROP**
  ```sql
  DROP TABLE Employees;
  ```

- **TRUNCATE**
  ```sql
  TRUNCATE TABLE Employees;
  ```

## 02 Data Manipulation Language (DML)
   - **Purpose:** Handles the manipulation of data within tables
   - **Common Commands**
     - `SELECT`: Retrieves data from one or more tables
     - `INSERT`: Adds new rows of data to a table
     - `UPDATE`: Modifies existing data within a table
     - `DELETE`: Removes data from a table

- **SELECT**
  ```sql
  SELECT FirstName, LastName, Department
  FROM Employees
  WHERE Department = 'HR';
  ```

- **INSERT**
  ```sql
  INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Department)
  VALUES (1, 'John', 'Doe', 'HR');
  ```

- **UPDATE**
  ```sql
  UPDATE Employees
  SET Department = 'Finance'
  WHERE EmployeeID = 1;
  ```

- **DELETE**
  ```sql
  DELETE FROM Employees
  WHERE EmployeeID = 1;
  ```

## 03 Data Control Language (DCL)
   - **Purpose:** Manages access rights to the data within the database
   - **Common Commands**
     - `GRANT`: Gives users access privileges to the database
     - `REVOKE`: Removes access privileges from users

- **GRANT**
  ```sql
  GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON Employees TO User1;
  ```

- **REVOKE**
  ```sql
  REVOKE INSERT ON Employees FROM User1;
  ```

## 04 Transaction Control Language (TCL)
   - **Purpose:** Manages the changes made by DML statements, ensuring data integrity
   - **Common Commands**
     - `COMMIT`: Saves the changes made by the current transaction
     - `ROLLBACK`: Reverts the changes made by the current transaction
     - `SAVEPOINT`: Sets a save point within a transaction that you can rollback to

- **COMMIT**
  ```sql
  BEGIN TRANSACTION;
  
  UPDATE Employees
  SET Department = 'IT'
  WHERE EmployeeID = 2;

  COMMIT;
  ```

- **ROLLBACK**
  ```sql
  BEGIN TRANSACTION;
  
  UPDATE Employees
  SET Department = 'IT'
  WHERE EmployeeID = 2;

  ROLLBACK;
  ```

- **SAVEPOINT**
  ```sql
  BEGIN TRANSACTION;

  SAVEPOINT SavePoint1;

  UPDATE Employees
  SET Department = 'Marketing'
  WHERE EmployeeID = 3;

  ROLLBACK TO SavePoint1;
  ```

## 05 Data Query Language (DQL)
   - **Purpose:** Queries the database for information
   - **Common Command**
     - `SELECT`: Though part of DML, `SELECT` is sometimes categorized under DQL because it is used primarily for querying the database

- **SELECT**
  ```sql
  SELECT FirstName, LastName
  FROM Employees
  WHERE Department = 'IT';
  ```
