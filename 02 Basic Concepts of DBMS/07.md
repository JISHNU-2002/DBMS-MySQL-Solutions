# 07 Basic Concepts of DBMS  
- **Database Schema**
- **Tables, Rows, and Columns**
- **DBMS Keys**
- **Normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF)**
- **Indexes**
## 01 Database Schema
   - A schema is the structure of a database, defining how data is organized into tables
   - It includes the tables, fields, data types, and relationships between tables
   - The schema acts as a blueprint for the database, guiding how data is stored, organized, and accessed
   - For example, in an e-commerce database, you might have a schema with tables for `Customers`, `Orders`, and `Products`

## 02 Tables, Rows, and Columns
   - **Tables**
     - The fundamental building blocks of a database
     - A table is a collection of related data entries organized in rows and columns
     - **Example:** A `Users` table might have columns like `UserID`, `Username`, `Email`, and `Password`
   - **Rows**
     - Also known as records or tuples, rows represent a single entry in a table
     - **Example:** A single row in the `Users` table could represent one user’s data, such as `1, "johndoe", "john@example.com", "password123"`
   - **Columns**
     - Also known as fields or attributes, columns define the data type and characteristics of the data stored in each row
     - **Example:** The `Email` column in the `Users` table might be defined as a string that stores the user's email addresses

## 03 DBMS Keys
### 1. **Primary Key**
   - **Definition:** A primary key is a unique identifier for each record in a table. It ensures that no two rows have the same value in this column or set of columns.
   - **Properties:**
     - Uniqueness: Each value in the primary key column(s) must be unique across the table.
     - Not Null: A primary key cannot contain NULL values.
     - A table can have only one primary key.
   - **Example:** In a `Students` table, the `StudentID` column could be the primary key, uniquely identifying each student.

### 2. **Foreign Key**
   - **Definition:** A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in one table that refers to the primary key in another table. It is used to establish a relationship between the two tables.
   - **Properties:**
     - The foreign key value must match an existing primary key value in the referenced table, ensuring referential integrity.
     - A table can have multiple foreign keys.
   - **Example:** In an `Orders` table, the `CustomerID` column could be a foreign key that references the `CustomerID` primary key in a `Customers` table, linking each order to a customer.

### 3. **Candidate Key**
   - **Definition:** A candidate key is a column, or a set of columns, that can uniquely identify any record in a table. Each table can have multiple candidate keys.
   - **Properties:**
     - Uniqueness: Each candidate key must have unique values across the table.
     - Not Null: A candidate key cannot contain NULL values.
     - One of the candidate keys is selected as the primary key, while others can be considered as alternate keys.
   - **Example:** In a `Students` table, both `StudentID` and `Email` could be candidate keys because they can uniquely identify each student.

### 4. **Super Key**
   - **Definition:** A super key is any combination of columns that uniquely identifies a row in a table. It includes candidate keys as well as any superset of candidate keys.
   - **Properties:**
     - Uniqueness: A super key can uniquely identify each row in a table.
     - Can be composed of one or more columns.
     - Super keys include all candidate keys, and any candidate key is a minimal super key.
   - **Example:** In a `Students` table, both `StudentID` and the combination of `StudentID` + `Email` can be super keys.

### 5. **Alternate Key**
   - **Definition:** An alternate key is any candidate key that is not selected as the primary key. It is an alternative option for unique identification of records in the table.
   - **Properties:**
     - Like candidate keys, alternate keys must be unique and not null.
   - **Example:** If `StudentID` is chosen as the primary key in the `Students` table, `Email` would be an alternate key.

### 6. **Composite Key**
   - **Definition:** A composite key is a primary key that consists of two or more columns that together uniquely identify a row in a table.
   - **Properties:**
     - The combination of the columns in the composite key must be unique.
     - None of the individual columns can uniquely identify the row by themselves.
   - **Example:** In a `CourseRegistrations` table, a combination of `StudentID` and `CourseID` could be used as a composite key to uniquely identify each registration.

### 7. **Unique Key**
   - **Definition:** A unique key is a constraint that ensures all values in a column or a set of columns are unique across the table, similar to a primary key but can allow one NULL value.
   - **Properties:**
     - Uniqueness: Ensures all values are unique.
     - Allows NULL values, but only one NULL per column.
     - A table can have multiple unique keys.
   - **Example:** In a `Users` table, the `Username` column might be set as a unique key to prevent duplicate usernames.

### 8. **Surrogate Key**
   - **Definition:** A surrogate key is an artificial key, usually an auto-incremented number, that is added to a table to act as a primary key.
   - **Properties:**
     - Surrogate keys have no business meaning and are typically generated by the database system.
     - Often used when no natural primary key exists or when natural keys are too complex.
   - **Example:** In a `Books` table, an auto-incremented `BookID` might be used as a surrogate key, even if each book has a unique ISBN.

### 9. **Natural Key**
   - **Definition:** A natural key is a key that has a logical relationship to the data it represents, often derived from the data itself.
   - **Properties:**
     - Has business meaning and is not artificially created.
     - Could be a candidate key or even a primary key if it uniquely identifies records.
   - **Example:** In a `Employees` table, an `EmployeeID` derived from an employee’s badge number might be a natural key

## 04 Normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF)
   - **Normalization**
     - The process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity
   - **1NF (First Normal Form)**
     - Ensures that each column contains atomic values (indivisible) and that each column in a table contains unique data
     - **Example:** A table with repeated columns for phone numbers would not be in 1NF; instead, each phone number should be in a separate row
   - **2NF (Second Normal Form)**
     - Achieved when a table is in 1NF, and all non-primary key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the primary key
     - **Example:** In a table with a composite primary key, all non-key columns should depend on the entire key, not just part of it
   - **3NF (Third Normal Form)**
     - Achieved when a table is in 2NF, and all the attributes are functionally dependent only on the primary key
     - **Example:** If a table contains a column `City` that depends on `ZipCode`, which in turn depends on the `CustomerID`, moving `City` and `ZipCode` to a new table linked by `CustomerID` brings the table into 3NF
   - **BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form)**
     - A stricter version of 3NF where every determinant (a column or set of columns on which another column is fully dependent) must be a candidate key
     - **Example:** If a table has more than one candidate key, all of them must be a determinant for the table to be in BCNF

### 1. **First Normal Form (1NF)**
**1NF** is the simplest form of normalization and requires that:
   - Each table has a primary key
   - Each column contains atomic (indivisible) values
   - Each column contains only one value per row (no repeating groups or arrays)

#### **Example:**
Consider a table storing student information and their enrolled courses:

| StudentID | StudentName | Courses              |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------|
| 1         | John        | Math, Science        |
| 2         | Jane        | English, History     |
| 3         | Bob         | Math, English, Art   |

**Problem:** The `Courses` column contains multiple values (a list of courses), violating the atomic value rule.

**1NF Solution:** Split the courses into individual rows:

| StudentID | StudentName | Course   |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| 1         | John        | Math     |
| 1         | John        | Science  |
| 2         | Jane        | English  |
| 2         | Jane        | History  |
| 3         | Bob         | Math     |
| 3         | Bob         | English  |
| 3         | Bob         | Art      |

Now, each column contains atomic values, and the table is in 1NF.

### 2. **Second Normal Form (2NF)**
**2NF** is achieved when:
   - The table is in 1NF
   - All non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the primary key

#### **Example:**
Consider a `CourseRegistrations` table in 1NF with a composite primary key:

| StudentID | CourseID | StudentName | CourseName | Instructor |
|-----------|----------|-------------|------------|------------|
| 1         | 101      | John        | Math       | Dr. Smith  |
| 2         | 102      | Jane        | English    | Dr. Brown  |
| 3         | 101      | Bob         | Math       | Dr. Smith  |

**Problem:** The `StudentName` depends only on `StudentID`, and `CourseName` and `Instructor` depend only on `CourseID`, not on the entire composite primary key (`StudentID` + `CourseID`).

**2NF Solution:** Split the table into two tables:

**Students Table:**

| StudentID | StudentName |
|-----------|-------------|
| 1         | John        |
| 2         | Jane        |
| 3         | Bob         |

**Courses Table:**

| CourseID | CourseName | Instructor |
|----------|------------|------------|
| 101      | Math       | Dr. Smith  |
| 102      | English    | Dr. Brown  |

**CourseRegistrations Table:**

| StudentID | CourseID |
|-----------|----------|
| 1         | 101      |
| 2         | 102      |
| 3         | 101      |

Now, the `CourseRegistrations` table is in 2NF because all non-key attributes are fully dependent on the entire primary key.

### 3. **Third Normal Form (3NF)**
**3NF** is achieved when:
   - The table is in 2NF
   - There are no transitive dependencies (i.e., non-key attributes do not depend on other non-key attributes)

#### **Example:**
Consider a `Students` table in 2NF:

| StudentID | StudentName | AdvisorID | AdvisorName |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| 1         | John        | 201       | Dr. Allen   |
| 2         | Jane        | 202       | Dr. Baker   |
| 3         | Bob         | 201       | Dr. Allen   |

**Problem:** `AdvisorName` depends on `AdvisorID`, which is not a primary key but is a non-key attribute. This creates a transitive dependency.

**3NF Solution:** Split the table into two tables:

**Students Table:**

| StudentID | StudentName | AdvisorID |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| 1         | John        | 201       |
| 2         | Jane        | 202       |
| 3         | Bob         | 201       |

**Advisors Table:**

| AdvisorID | AdvisorName |
|-----------|-------------|
| 201       | Dr. Allen   |
| 202       | Dr. Baker   |

Now, the `Students` table is in 3NF because there are no transitive dependencies.

### 4. **Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)**
**BCNF** is a stricter version of 3NF. A table is in BCNF if:
   - It is in 3NF
   - For every functional dependency (A → B), A should be a super key

#### **Example:**
Consider a `ClassAssignments` table:

| ClassID | TeacherID | TeacherName |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| 1       | 101       | Mr. Smith   |
| 2       | 102       | Ms. Johnson |
| 1       | 103       | Ms. Brown   |

**Problem:** `ClassID` and `TeacherID` both determine `TeacherName`, but neither `ClassID` nor `TeacherID` is a super key by themselves.

**BCNF Solution:** Create separate tables:

**Classes Table:**

| ClassID | TeacherID |
|---------|-----------|
| 1       | 101       |
| 2       | 102       |
| 1       | 103       |

**Teachers Table:**

| TeacherID | TeacherName |
|-----------|-------------|
| 101       | Mr. Smith   |
| 102       | Ms. Johnson |
| 103       | Ms. Brown   |

Now, each determinant is a super key, and the table is in BCNF.

## 05 Indexes
   - Indexes are special database objects that improve the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table
   - By creating an index on one or more columns, you can make queries that filter or sort data by those columns much faster
   - **Types:**
     - **Primary Index:** Automatically created on the primary key of a table
     - **Secondary Index:** Created on columns other than the primary key to speed up query performance
   - **Example:** An index on the `Email` column in a `Users` table would make searching for users by email faster
