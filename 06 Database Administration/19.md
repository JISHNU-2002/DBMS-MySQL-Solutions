# 19 Database Administration

# 1.  User Management and Privileges
- Managing users and their privileges is a crucial part of database administration
- This ensures that only authorized users can access and manipulate the database

- **Creating Users**: Use the `CREATE USER` statement to create new users
```sql
  CREATE USER 'username'@'host' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
```
  
- **Granting Privileges**: Use the `GRANT` statement to assign specific privileges to users
```sql
  GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON database_name.* TO 'username'@'host';
```
  
- **Revoking Privileges**: Use the `REVOKE` statement to remove privileges from users
```sql
  REVOKE SELECT, INSERT ON database_name.* FROM 'username'@'host';
```

- **Dropping Users**: Use the `DROP USER` statement to remove users
```sql
  DROP USER 'username'@'host';
```

# 2. Backup and Restore
- Regular backups are essential to prevent data loss
- There are several methods to back up and restore data in MySQL

- **Backup using `mysqldump`**: This command creates a logical backup of the database
```bash
  mysqldump -u username -p database_name > backup_file.sql
```

- **Restore using `mysql`**: This command restores the backup created by `mysqldump`
```bash
  mysql -u username -p database_name < backup_file.sql
```

# 3. Replication (Master-Slave Replication)
- Replication involves copying and maintaining database objects, such as tables, from one database (the master) to another (the slave)

### 01 **Configure the Master**
- Edit the `my.cnf` file to include:
```ini
[mysqld]
log-bin=mysql-bin
server-id=1
```

- Restart MySQL and create a replication user:
```SQL
CREATE USER 'replica_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO 'replica_user'@'%';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

- Get the master status:
```SQL
SHOW MASTER STATUS;
```

### 02 **Configure the Slave**
- Edit the `my.cnf` file to include:
```ini
[mysqld]
server-id=2
```

- Restart MySQL and configure the slave:
```sql
CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_HOST='master_host', MASTER_USER='replica_user', MASTER_PASSWORD='password', MASTER_LOG_FILE='mysql-bin.000001', MASTER_LOG_POS=107;
START SLAVE;
```


## MySQL Configuration File
- The `my.cnf` (or `my.ini` on Windows) file is the main configuration file for MySQL
- This file contains various settings that control the behavior of the MySQL server
- Hereâ€™s how to locate and modify this file, and how to apply the changes

### 01 Locating the MySQL Configuration File
#### On Linux or macOS:
The `my.cnf` file is usually located in one of the following directories:
- `/etc/my.cnf`
- `/etc/mysql/my.cnf`
- `/usr/local/mysql/etc/my.cnf`
- `~/.my.cnf` (for user-specific configurations)

#### On Windows:
The `my.ini` file is typically located in the MySQL installation directory, such as:
- `C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server X.Y\my.ini`
- `C:\ProgramData\MySQL\MySQL Server X.Y\my.ini`

### 02 Modifying the Configuration File
1. **Open the Configuration File**
   - Use a text editor with administrative or root privileges to open the file

   #### On Linux or macOS:
```bash
   sudo nano /etc/mysql/my.cnf
```

- On Windows:
	- Open the file with a text editor like Notepad with administrative privileges. Right-click on Notepad and select "Run as administrator," then open the `my.ini` file from the File menu


2. **Edit the Configuration File**
   - Add or modify the required settings. For example, to configure replication, you might add:
```ini
   [mysqld]
   server-id=1
   log-bin=mysql-bin
```


3. **Save and Close the File**
   - After making the necessary changes, save the file and close the text editor

### 03 Applying the Configuration Changes
1. **Restarting the MySQL Service**
- After editing the configuration file, you need to restart the MySQL service for the changes to take effect

#### On Linux or macOS:
```bash
   sudo systemctl restart mysql
```
   
   - or, if you are using an older version of MySQL or a different init system:
```bash
   sudo service mysql restart
```

#### On Windows:
1. Open the Services manager (you can find it by searching for `services.msc` in the Start menu)
2. Locate the MySQL service, right-click on it, and select "Restart"

- Alternatively, you can restart the service using the command line:
```cmd
   net stop MySQL
   net start MySQL
```

2. **Verifying the Changes**
- To ensure that your changes have been applied correctly, you can log into the MySQL server and check the current configuration

```sql
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'server_id';
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'log_bin';
```

- This will display the current values of `server_id` and `log_bin`, confirming that your changes have been applied


# 4. Security Best Practices
- **Use Strong Passwords**: Ensure all users have strong, unique passwords
- **Limit User Privileges**: Grant only the necessary privileges to each user
- **Enable SSL/TLS**: Encrypt connections between clients and the MySQL server
- **Regular Updates**: Keep MySQL and its dependencies up to date to protect against vulnerabilities


# 5. Monitoring and Performance Tuning
- **Monitoring**: Use tools like MySQL Enterprise Monitor, Nagios, or custom scripts to monitor database performance and health
- **Performance Tuning**
    - **Indexes**: Ensure proper indexing to speed up query performance
    - **Query Optimization**: Use `EXPLAIN` to understand and optimize query execution plans
    - **Buffer Pool Size**: Adjust `innodb_buffer_pool_size` for InnoDB to efficiently use memory


# 6. MySQL Configuration
- MySQL configuration is typically done in the `my.cnf` (or `my.ini` on Windows) file
- Each configuration parameter can significantly impact the performance, security, and stability of the MySQL server
- Regular review and adjustment of these settings based on the database workload and performance metrics are necessary to ensure optimal operation
- Key configuration parameters include:
- **Networking**
```ini
[mysqld]
bind-address=0.0.0.0
```

- **Memory Allocation**
```ini
[mysqld]
innodb_buffer_pool_size=1G
```

- **Logging**
```ini
[mysqld]
log-error=/var/log/mysql/error.log
```

- **Replication**
```ini
[mysqld]
server-id=1
log-bin=mysql-bin
```
