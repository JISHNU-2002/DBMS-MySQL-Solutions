# Introduction to Databases
- **Databases**
- **DBMS vs. RDBMS**
- **SQL vs. NoSQL**
- **Popular Database Systems (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, etc.)**

## 01 Databases
   - A database is an organized collection of data, generally stored and accessed electronically from a computer system\
   - It allows for data to be stored, retrieved, and manipulated efficiently
   - Databases are used to store large volumes of data in a structured way so that it can be easily managed and retrieved

## 02 DBMS vs RDBMS
   - **DBMS (Database Management System)**
     - A software that manages databases
     - It allows users to create, read, update, and delete data in a database
     - Examples: Microsoft Access, SQLite
   - **RDBMS (Relational Database Management System)**
     - A type of DBMS that stores data in tables and allows for relationships between tables
     - It follows the principles of relational model (e.g., data is stored in tables with rows and columns)
     - Examples: **MySQL**, PostgreSQL, Oracle
     - In RDBMS, relationships between data are defined using foreign keys, whereas DBMS might not support this concept

## 03 SQL vs NoSQL
   - **SQL (Structured Query Language)**
     - A standard language used to communicate with relational databases
     - It is used to perform operations like querying, updating, and managing data
     - **Examples of SQL databases:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server
   - **NoSQL (Not Only SQL)**
     - Refers to non-relational databases that store data in formats other than tables
     - Useful for handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data
     - **Examples of NoSQL databases:** MongoDB (document-based), Redis (key-value store), Cassandra (column-family store)
     - SQL databases use structured schemas with tables and relationships, while NoSQL databases can use flexible schemas or no schema at all

## 04 Popular Database Systems
   - **MySQL** 
     - An open-source relational database management system
     - Widely used in web applications and known for its reliability and ease of use
   - **PostgreSQL**
     - An advanced open-source RDBMS known for its compliance with SQL standards and support for complex queries
   - **Oracle**
     - A powerful RDBMS used in large enterprise environments, known for its robustness and scalability
   - **SQLite**
     - A lightweight, self-contained SQL database engine that is commonly used in mobile apps and small-scale applications
