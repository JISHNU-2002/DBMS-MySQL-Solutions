## 01 **SQL Syntax**

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```
- **SELECT:** Specifies the columns to retrieve
- **FROM:** Specifies the table to query
- **WHERE:** Filters records based on a condition

## 02 **Data Types in MySQL**
Data types define the type of data that can be stored in a column

**Common Data Types:**
- **INT:** Integer values
- **VARCHAR(size):** Variable-length string with a maximum length defined by `size`
- **DATE:** Date in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`
- **FLOAT:** Floating-point numbers

**Example:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE Products (
    ProductID INT,
    ProductName VARCHAR(100),
    Price FLOAT,
    ManufactureDate DATE
);
```
- **Explanation:** This creates a `Products` table with four columns: an integer `ProductID`, a string `ProductName`, a floating-point `Price`, and a date `ManufactureDate`

## 03 **Basic SQL Operations**
#### **SELECT**
Retrieves data from a table

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT ProductName, Price 
FROM Products;
```
- **Explanation:** Retrieves the `ProductName` and `Price` columns from the `Products` table

#### **INSERT**
Inserts new data into a table

**Example:**
```sql
INSERT INTO Products (ProductID, ProductName, Price, ManufactureDate)
VALUES (1, 'Laptop', 800.00, '2023-08-01');
```
- **Explanation:** Inserts a new product with an ID of 1, a name of 'Laptop', a price of 800.00, and a manufacture date of August 1, 2023

#### **UPDATE**
Updates existing data in a table

**Example:**
```sql
UPDATE Products 
SET Price = 850.00 
WHERE ProductID = 1;
```
- **Explanation:** Updates the price of the product with `ProductID` 1 to 850.00

#### **DELETE**
Deletes data from a table

**Example:**
```sql
DELETE FROM Products 
WHERE ProductID = 1;
```
- **Explanation:** Deletes the record with `ProductID` 1 from the `Products` table

## 04 **Filtering Data**
These operations are used to filter and sort the data retrieved from a table

#### **WHERE**
Filters records based on a specific condition

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM Products 
WHERE Price > 500;
```
- **Explanation:** Retrieves all products with a price greater than 500

#### **ORDER BY**
Sorts the result set by one or more columns

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM Products 
ORDER BY Price DESC;
```
- **Explanation:** Retrieves all products sorted by price in descending order

#### **GROUP BY**
Groups rows that have the same values in specified columns and allows aggregate functions (like `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, etc.) to be applied to each group

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT Department, COUNT(EmployeeID) AS NumberOfEmployees
FROM Employees
GROUP BY Department;
```

- **Explanation:** Groups employees by department and counts the number of employees in each department. The result will show the department name and the corresponding number of employees in that department

#### **DISTINCT**
Retrieves unique values from a column

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT ProductName 
FROM Products;
```
- **Explanation:** Retrieves unique product names from the `Products` table

## 05 **Aggregate Functions**
These functions perform calculations on multiple rows of a table and return a single value

#### **COUNT**
Counts the number of rows

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM Products;
```
- **Explanation:** Returns the total number of products

#### **SUM**
Calculates the total sum of a numeric column

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT SUM(Price) 
FROM Products;
```
- **Explanation:** Returns the total sum of all product prices

#### **AVG**
Calculates the average value of a numeric column

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT AVG(Price) 
FROM Products;
```
- **Explanation:** Returns the average price of all products

#### **MIN**
Finds the minimum value in a column

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT MIN(Price) 
FROM Products;
```
- **Explanation:** Returns the lowest price among all products

#### **MAX**
Finds the maximum value in a column

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT MAX(Price) 
FROM Products;
```
- **Explanation:** Returns the highest price among all products

## 06 **Joins**
Joins are used to retrieve data from multiple tables based on a related column

#### **INNER JOIN**
Returns records that have matching values in both tables

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName 
FROM Orders
INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID;
```
- **Explanation:** Retrieves order IDs and customer names for orders where there is a matching customer

#### **LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN)**
Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table. Unmatched records from the right table will return `NULL`

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID 
FROM Customers
LEFT JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;
```
- **Explanation:** Retrieves all customers and their order IDs. If a customer has no orders, `NULL` is returned for the order ID

#### **RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN)**
Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table. Unmatched records from the left table will return `NULL`

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName 
FROM Orders
RIGHT JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID;
```
- **Explanation:** Retrieves all orders and their associated customer names. If an order has no matching customer, `NULL` is returned for the customer name

#### **FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN)**
Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table. Unmatched records from either table will return `NULL`

**Note:** MySQL doesn't directly support `FULL JOIN`. You can simulate it using `UNION`

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID 
FROM Customers
LEFT JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID
UNION
SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID 
FROM Orders
RIGHT JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID;
```
- **Explanation:** Retrieves all customers and their order IDs, including those customers with no orders and orders with no matching customer

## 07 **Subqueries**
A subquery is a query within another query. It provides a way to retrieve data to be used in the main query

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT ProductName 
FROM Products 
WHERE Price > (SELECT AVG(Price) FROM Products);
```
- **Explanation:** Retrieves product names where the price is greater than the average price of all products

## 08 **Aliases**
Aliases provide a temporary name for a table or column. It is useful for renaming columns or tables to make the query more readable

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT ProductName AS Name, Price AS Cost 
FROM Products;
```
- **Explanation:** Renames the `ProductName` column as `Name` and `Price` as `Cost` in the result set
